`ggblur` provides an augmented version of `geom_point()` which adds **blur** as
an aesthetic.

#### What's in the box?

* `geom_point_blur()`
    * same as `geom_point()` but accepts `blur_size` as a mappable aesthetic
    * also allows for setting of `blur_steps` and `blur_alpha`
* `scale_blur_size_continuous()`, `scale_blur_size_discrete()` and `scale_blur_size_manual()` 
   for controlling blur size.


#### Similar packages

* [ggecho](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/ggecho) is an earlier experiment of
  mine from 2019 where I echo components using a custom stat `stat_echo`.  This 
  solution works across multiple geoms, but didn't allow for adjusting the
  echo for individual points.
* [ggfx](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggfx) adds blur at the layer level i.e. 
  no individual control over the amount of blur for each point.


#### How it works

Given the current lack of radial gradients in grid graphics, blur 
is simulated by rendering multiple points at the given location.

However, Paul Murrell has some experiments to add radial gradients to grid graphics - see
  [his github](https://github.com/pmur002/r-defs-proposal). When this
  eventuates



## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/ggblur) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("coolbutuseless/ggblur")
```

## Example 1 - constant `blur_size` 

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example1}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggblur)

ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point_blur(aes(mpg, wt), blur_size = 10) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title = "Same blur for each point")
```

## Example 2 - mapping `blur_size` as an aesthetic

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example2}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggblur)

ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point_blur(aes(mpg, wt, blur_size = disp)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title = "Larger blur indicates larger engine displacement")
```


## Example 3 - control over blur parameters
```{r example3}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point_blur(aes(mpg, wt, blur_size = disp), blur_alpha = 0.3, blur_steps = 2) +
  scale_blur_size_continuous(range = c(1, 15)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title = "Larger blur indicates larger engine displacement")
```
